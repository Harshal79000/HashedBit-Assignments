// 3. You need to write a function findTax() that takes a number type variable as an argument which is the salary of a person. You need to calculate the tax amount on his salary by using the Js switch control flow. The tax rates are given below.
// if 500000 >= salary > 0 then 0% tax on the entire salary.
// If 1000000 >= salary > 500000 then 10% tax on the entire salary.
// If 1500000 >= salary > 1000000 then 20% tax on the entire salary.
// If the salary > 1500000 then 30% tax on the entire salary.

function findTax(salary) {
    let tax;
  
    switch (true) {
      case salary > 1500000:
        tax = salary * 0.3;
        break;
      case salary > 1000000:
        tax = salary * 0.2;
        break;
      case salary > 500000:
        tax = salary * 0.1;
        break;
      case salary >= 0:
        tax = 0;
        break;
      default:
        tax = 'Invalid salary';
    }
  
    return tax;
  }
  
  console.log(findTax(400000));
  console.log(findTax(600000));
  console.log(findTax(1200000));
  console.log(findTax(2000000));
  console.log(findTax(-50000));
